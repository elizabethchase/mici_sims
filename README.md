# mici_sims

This repository houses code to reproduce the simulations performed in Chase, Boonstra,
and Taylor (2025+). To run the simulations, you will need to install the corresponding mici
R package from https://github.com/elizabethchase/mici. The repo contains the following scripts:

- data_gen.R: an R script to simulate data used for num_imp_sims.R and overall_sims.R.

- figs_tables.Rmd: a Markdown file to create all of the simulation plots in Chase et al. (2025+)
using results generated by the other R scripts.

- num_imp_sims.R: an R script to conduct simulations investigating the effect of the number of 
imputations on performance.

- overall_sims.R: this R script is the primary simulation script and carries out almost all
of the simulations in Chase et al. (2025+).

- RGI.R: this R script implements the imputation approach of Ruan & Gray (2008).

- RGI_correct.R: this R script implements a correction to Ruan & Gray (2008)'s imputation approach.

- tie_sims.R: this R script carries out simulations in the presence of tied data.
